# Regular Expressions in Python üîÑ

## Overview
Regular Expressions (regex) are a powerful tool for pattern matching and text manipulation. They allow you to find, extract, and manipulate strings based on specific patterns. Python provides the `re` module to work with regex, making tasks like data validation, searching, and replacing text efficient and straightforward.

---

## Why Use Regular Expressions?
- **üîç Searching Text:** Find specific words or patterns in large data.
- **üéõÔ∏è Data Validation:** Validate formats like email addresses, phone numbers, etc.
- **‚úèÔ∏è Text Manipulation:** Replace, split, or extract parts of text based on patterns.
- **üîÑ Efficiency:** Handle complex string processing tasks in fewer lines of code.

---

## Key Regex Functions in Python
Here are the commonly used functions in the `re` module:

1. `re.match()` - Checks for a match only at the beginning of the string.
2. `re.search()` - Searches the entire string for the first match.
3. `re.findall()` - Returns a list of all matches.
4. `re.sub()` - Replaces occurrences of a pattern with a given string.
5. `re.split()` - Splits a string by the occurrences of a pattern.

## Real-World Examples üåç

### 1. Validating Email Addresses üìß
```python
import re

def validate_email(email):
    pattern = r"^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$"
    return bool(re.match(pattern, email))

# Example Usage
email = "example@gmail.com"
print(validate_email(email))  # Output: True
```
**How it works:**
- `^` and `$` ensure the pattern matches the entire string.
- `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+` matches the username part.
- `@` matches the @ symbol.
- `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+` matches the domain.
- `\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}` ensures the domain ends with at least two letters.

---

### 2. Extracting Phone Numbers üìû
```python
import re

def extract_phone_numbers(text):
    pattern = r"\b\d{3}[-.\s]?\d{3}[-.\s]?\d{4}\b"
    return re.findall(pattern, text)

# Example Usage
text = "Contact me at 123-456-7890 or 987.654.3210."
print(extract_phone_numbers(text))  # Output: ['123-456-7890', '987.654.3210']
```
**How it works:**
- `\b` ensures the match is a whole word.
- `\d{3}` matches the first three digits.
- `[-.\s]?` matches optional separators (-, ., or space).
- `\d{4}` matches the last four digits.

---

### 3. Replacing Sensitive Information with Asterisks üõ°Ô∏è
```python
import re

def mask_credit_card(text):
    pattern = r"\b\d{4}[-.\s]?\d{4}[-.\s]?\d{4}[-.\s]?\d{4}\b"
    return re.sub(pattern, "****-****-****-****", text)

# Example Usage
text = "My credit card number is 1234-5678-9101-1121."
print(mask_credit_card(text))  # Output: My credit card number is ****-****-****-****.
```
**How it works:**
- Similar to the phone number pattern, this matches credit card numbers.
- `re.sub()` replaces matched patterns with `****-****-****-****`.

---

### 4. Splitting a Sentence into Words ‚úâ
```python
import re

def split_sentence(sentence):
    pattern = r"\W+"
    return re.split(pattern, sentence)

# Example Usage
sentence = "Hello, world! Welcome to Python programming."
print(split_sentence(sentence))  # Output: ['Hello', 'world', 'Welcome', 'to', 'Python', 'programming']
```
**How it works:**
- `\W+` matches any sequence of non-word characters (punctuation, spaces, etc.).
- `re.split()` uses this pattern to split the string into words.

---

### 5. Finding All Hashtags in a Tweet üåü
```python
import re

def find_hashtags(tweet):
    pattern = r"#\w+"
    return re.findall(pattern, tweet)

# Example Usage
tweet = "Loving the #Python community! #CodingIsFun #100DaysOfCode"
print(find_hashtags(tweet))  # Output: ['#Python', '#CodingIsFun', '#100DaysOfCode']
```
**How it works:**
- `#` matches the hashtag symbol.
- `\w+` matches the word following the hashtag.
- `re.findall()` returns all matches as a list.

---

## Tips for Writing Regex Patterns üîß
- **Use Raw Strings:** Always use `r""` to avoid escaping backslashes.
- **Test Patterns:** Use tools like [Regex101](https://regex101.com/) to test your patterns.
- **Keep It Simple:** Write patterns incrementally and test at each step.

## üìã Table Regular Expression Pattern Syntax

| **üî§ Element**             | **üìñ Meaning**                                                                                                                                                    |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`.`**                   | Matches **any single character** except a newline (`\n`). This is like a wildcard that can be any letter, number, or symbol.                                       |
| **`^`**                   | Matches the **start of a string**. If `MULTILINE` mode is enabled, it also matches the position right after a newline (`\n`).                                      |
| **`$`**                   | Matches the **end of a string**. In `MULTILINE` mode, it also matches the position right before a newline (`\n`).                                                  |
| **`*`**                   | Matches **zero or more occurrences** of the preceding pattern; it's **greedy** (tries to match as much as possible).                                               |
| **`+`**                   | Matches **one or more occurrences** of the preceding pattern; **greedy**.                                                                                         |
| **`?`**                   | Matches **zero or one occurrence** of the preceding pattern; **greedy**. It is useful for optional characters or patterns.                                          |
| **`*?`, `+?`, `??`**      | These are **nongreedy** (or **lazy**) versions of `*`, `+`, and `?` respectively. They match as **few characters as possible**.                                    |
| **`{m,n}`**               | Matches **between `m` and `n` occurrences** of the preceding pattern; **greedy**. You can use it to specify exact repetition.                                      |
| **`{m,n}?`**              | Matches **between `m` and `n` occurrences** of the preceding pattern; **nongreedy**.                                                                               |
| **`[...]`**               | Matches **any one character** from a set inside the brackets. For example, `[abc]` matches `a`, `b`, or `c`.                                                       |
| **`[^...]`**              | Matches **any one character not** in the set inside the brackets. For example, `[^abc]` matches any character except `a`, `b`, or `c`.                              |
| **`|`**                   | Acts like a logical **OR**; matches **either** the pattern before or after it. For example, `cat|dog` matches "cat" or "dog".                                       |
| **`(...)`**               | Matches the pattern inside the parentheses and **creates a capturing group**. Use it to group patterns for extraction or backreferences.                           |
| **`(?:...)`**             | Matches the pattern inside the parentheses but **does not create a capturing group**. Useful for grouping without capturing.                                       |
| **`(?P<id>...)`**         | Matches the pattern and **names the group** as `id`. Named groups make patterns more readable and easier to reference.                                             |
| **`(?P=id)`**             | Matches **the same text** as previously matched by the named group `id`. Use it to refer back to the named group.                                                  |
| **`(?#...)`**             | A **comment** inside the regex pattern; helps improve readability without affecting the match.                                                                     |
| **`(?=...)`**             | **Positive lookahead**: Matches if the pattern matches what comes next, but does **not consume** any characters. Used to assert that something follows.            |
| **`(?!...)`**             | **Negative lookahead**: Matches if the pattern does **not** match what comes next, without consuming any characters. Useful for excluding patterns.                 |
| **`(?<=...)`**            | **Positive lookbehind**: Matches if the pattern precedes the current position; must match a fixed length. Ensures something comes before the match.                |
| **`(?<!...)`**            | **Negative lookbehind**: Matches if the pattern does **not** precede the current position; must match a fixed length.                                               |
| **`\number`**             | Matches the text previously matched by the group **numbered `number`**. Useful for reusing matched patterns.                                                      |
| **`\A`**                  | Matches the **start of the entire string**. Unlike `^`, it is not affected by `MULTILINE`.                                                                        |
| **`\b`**                  | Matches a **word boundary** (the start or end of a word). Helps match whole words only.                                                                            |
| **`\B`**                  | Matches a position that is **not a word boundary**. Useful for ensuring a match occurs within a word.                                                             |
| **`\d`**                  | Matches a **digit** (equivalent to `[0-9]`). In Unicode mode, it matches any Unicode digit.                                                                        |
| **`\D`**                  | Matches a **non-digit** (equivalent to `[^0-9]`).                                                                                                                 |
| **`\s`**                  | Matches a **whitespace character** (spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.).                                                                                                |
| **`\S`**                  | Matches a **non-whitespace character**.                                                                                                                           |
| **`\w`**                  | Matches an **alphanumeric character** (letters, digits, underscore). Equivalent to `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`.                                                                |
| **`\W`**                  | Matches a **non-alphanumeric character**.                                                                                                                         |
| **`\Z`**                  | Matches the **end of the entire string**. Unlike `$`, it is not affected by `MULTILINE`.                                                                          |
| **`\\`**                  | Matches a **literal backslash** (`\`) character. Useful for escaping special characters.                                                                           |
| **`(?iLmsux)`**           | Alternate way to **set optional flags** within a pattern. Flags control the regex behavior (case insensitivity, multiline mode, etc.).                             |

## Conclusion
Regular Expressions are an essential skill for any developer working with text data. With practice, they become an invaluable tool for solving real-world problems efficiently.
